# SafeDeliveries

SafeDeliveries is an application designed for everyone that needs to deliver items to a friend, colleague or anyone else. Sometimes we have products that we want to loan to a friend or we do trades online and we need a way to deliver the product to the buyer. Situations like these are covered by our app, which provides an easy, safe and fast mechanism to deliver these products between people.
